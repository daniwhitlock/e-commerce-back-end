# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Description
A back end program that allows your company to compete with other e-commerce companies. Specifically you can view, create, update, and delete: tags, categories, and products.

Also, to help keep sensitive information safe, this program uses a program called dotenv

## Installation
You will need to have the following programs downloaded: 
* MySQL2 package
* Dotenv
* Sequelize
* Express

## Usage 
This application can be used to create products, tags, and categories. Since this program is just a back-end application, here are some images of how the GET, PUT, POST, and DEL requests work in a program called Insomnia.
